# CSE314-MRem

Code for controlling the an mBot Ranger, with an extra BLE module.

Needs the Makeblock libraries from https://github.com/Makeblock-official/Makeblock-Libraries

1 meter is about 3000deg

This should be a command program, so the rover can accept commands over Serial/BLE and report back over the same medium.
