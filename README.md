# CSE314-MRem

Code for controlling the an mBot Ranger, with an extra BLE module.

Needs the Makeblock libraries from https://github.com/Makeblock-official/Makeblock-Libraries

This should be a command program, so the rover can accept commands over Serial/BLE and report back over the same medium.

Can be controlled over serial monitor/Bluetooth - meant to be controlled using [cse314-mbot-control](https://github.com/chrismooredev/cse314-mbot-control)

1 meter is about 3000deg
